                    Jackson Pollock was born on January 28, 1912 in Cody, Wyoming. He was an influential American painter and a major figure in the abstract expressionist movement.

                    While his family was living in Los Angeles, Pollock enrolled in the Manual Arts High School, where he discovered his passion for art. He was expelled twice before abandoning school for his creative pursuits

                    His techinque involved exploring abstraction expressionism via his splatter and action pieces, which involved pouring paint and other media directly onto canvases

                    Pollock's most famous paintings were made during his "drip period" between 1947 and 1950. He became wildly popular after being featured in a four-page spread in Life magazine. The article asked of Pollock, "Is he the greatest living painter in the United
                    States?"

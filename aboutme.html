            My name is Ashi Kamra. I'm a senior at the Cate School with an interest in Engineering, Computer Science, and the Arts! This project was made for the Advanced Computer Science class I'm currently in. Creating the canvas was certainly frustrating but I
            think I was able to get it to work better than I thought I would. If you're interested in seeing what my reference was, visit the website:
